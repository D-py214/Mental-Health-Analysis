# Mental-Health-Analysis
Developed a Machine learning project to predict Mental Health Disorders using a dataset of 120 entries and 19 features.

Created a predictive model to classify disorders based on psychological indicators.

Imported libraries (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, seaborn), loaded dataset, checked for missing values (0 found), converted categorical data to numerical using Label Encoder, and dropped the 'Patient Number' column.

Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets, utilized Random Forest Classifier to train the model, achieving an accuracy of 87.5%.

Generated a classification report with precision, recall, and F1-score, reporting an overall accuracy of 88%.

Successfully developed a predictive model for classifying mental health disorders, demonstrating high accuracy and reliability.
